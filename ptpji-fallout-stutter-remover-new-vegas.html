All the posts I've seen so far of people pointing it out, no one mentions Have you tried going into stutter remover.ini and scrolling down to critical sections and the line iDefaultMode = 3, change that value to 1 even after following the fix above.

Description: This plugin makes Fallout: New Vegas not "stutter" as much, and generally feel smoother or perform better. Spoilers ahead and I really don't understand why most people say NV is the best Fallout. I mean yes, it's a good game but imo it's not the best Fallout game. The map felt quite boring apart from Goodsprings which I liked and I had the opportunity to see Vegas for the first time during night time and safe to say, it was beautiful although my excitement came to and end pretty fast. I thought it's this big, sprawling city and what I found was underwhelming. Technical-side, it's quite unsta. For Everything Fallout: New Vegas. Feel free to discuss any aspect of the game you want.

Loading up a save crashes the game, fast travelling causes a CTD, starting a new game results in one of 3 things: A. A freeze, B. An infinite loading screen or C. It actually fucking works. I've tried a lot of things to remedy this but to no avail. I had an active plugin amount of 109, I reduced it to 77. Still nothing. Also if I leave or enter a cell then sometimes I get an infinite loading screen after a little while the game just straight up freezes. Any help would be tremendously appreciate. For people experiencing a weird "stutter" or "frame skip" that makes the game feel very unsmooth regardless of having well over 60 fps. 1) Go to your /documents/Fallout new vegas folder.

I tried running the game using nvse through MO but it won't even start. It just has a black screen. I'm on Windows 10 so I made sure to disable the 2 functions in NVSR so I don't think it's that. The first time I tried to run it was just after installing New Vegas Stutter Remover and it won't go past the nvse command prompt screen with the black background. I thought maybe I shoul. Have a 120+ plugins modded game. Was getting crashes about 15-20 mins after launching, turned out to be NVSR causing it. I disabled My FNV is up to date. I own all of the DLC. I have the following mods installed along with NVSR(New Vegas Stutter Remover): NVSE 4G FNV NVAC ENBSeries v0.322 (with no enb presets installed yet.) I came to the conclusion that NVSR is the problem because i uninstalled every mod back to the point where i knew the game was running fine and installed them one at a time testing to see which one causes the problem. I havent seen this bug talked about on any of the mods. I followed instructions.

I've got great specs (GTX 690, i5 3570k, 16GB Ram, Win 7 64-bit) and the stutter remover installed. It's been quite a while since I last played FO3, but hopping into some tunnels I was quite surprised by how dark it was, I'd much prefer if it was more visible, even without the Pipboy light on. I tried turning up the gamma all the way, but that just resulted in some odd behavior like when a fog passed in front of something it became much more visible/light.

Hello there! I've been attempting to play Fallout 3/New Vegas again, and recently came across the Tale of Two Wastelands mod which I found very exciting. The game will launch and load perfectly fine, and then after about 15 minutes it just freezes and stops working. I've verified the integrity on Steam multiple times. I've done the bUseThreadedAI = 1 and iNumHWThreads=2 thing. I've uninstalled and re-installed like three times. I've restarted my PC multiple times. I've restarted Steam. I have 19 mods installed 24 active plugins, and I've tried changing the load order of my mods a god-awful amount of times. Yes, I have NVAC and Stutter. I have so many post on here complaining about Fallout New Vegas, where do I even begin? Perhaps with stating that I have no stutter. I've pretty much given up on getting NV to stop crashing, I'm playing the GOG version and I have nvse, stutter remover and anti crash to no effect. I've set the game to windowed fullscreen with onetweak and capped the FPS with nvidia inspector. Changed compatibility to Windows 7, run as Admin and changed the bHookLightCriticalSections to 0 for Windows 10. It's consistently crashing either on cell loads in the world, looting in menus or going into load doors. EDIT: For someone else who might.

I value stability above My game randomly freezes then crashes (not an instant crash, the game isn't responding and I have to end the task) in both loading screens and walking around. That's honestly all I know and I'm so lost. I have the 4GB patch.
